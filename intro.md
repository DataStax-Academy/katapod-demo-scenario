              <i>
                This hands-on lab is built using the Katapod engine. If you have never encountered it before, this is how you use it:
              </i>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You will proceed through a series of steps on the left panel, advancing to the next step by the click of a button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On the right part of the lab, one or more consoles are spawned for you to execute commands and interact with the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each step provides instructions and explanations on what is going on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In particular, click on code blocks to execute them in their target console.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Commands that are executed already are marked as such. Usually you can execute a command as many times as you want (though this might not always be what you want to do).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <i><strong>Note:</strong> please do not leave the lab idle for longer than a few minutes, otherwise it would get hibernated, thereby losing some of its state, and you might need to start it all over.</i>

              This is a self-explanatory quickstart to creating Katapod scenarios. You can use it to
              peek at what Katapod has to offer, or copy the repo and start creating your own interactive lab.

              <strong>About Katapod:</strong>
              Katapod was born as a homegrown replacement for the now-discontinued Katacoda, as
              a specialized extension for VSCode Server running, in turn, within Gitpod images.
              For more, check out <a href="https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/katapod">Katapod</a> on Github.
            <br>
              We do our best to keep it up to date and use it to showcase all the features in the Katapod engine,
              so as to serve as a quick smoke-test when updates to the engine are released.
            </p>
